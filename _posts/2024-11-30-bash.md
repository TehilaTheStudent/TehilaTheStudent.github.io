### **Bash Scripting Cheat Sheet**

---

#### **Bash Options**
- `set -e`: Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
- `set -u`: Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
- `set -o pipefail`: Return the exit status of the last command in a pipeline that failed.
- `set -x`: Print each command and its arguments before executing (useful for debugging).

---

#### **Conditional Statements**
- **`if ... then ... fi`**: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.
- **`case ... esac`**: Selects one of many blocks of code to be executed.

---

#### **Loops**
1. **For Loop**: Iterates through a list of items.
   ```bash
   for item in list; do
       echo $item
   done
   ```
2. **While Loop**: Executes as long as a condition is true.
   ```bash
   while [condition]; do
       command
   done
   ```
3. **Until Loop**: Executes until a condition becomes true.
   ```bash
   until [condition]; do
       command
   done
   ```

---

#### **Functions**
- **Define a Function**:
   ```bash
   function_name() {
       # Your code here
   }
   ```
- **Return a Value**:
   ```bash
   return [value]
   ```

---

#### **Test Conditions**
1. **File Tests**:
   - `-f`: File exists and is a regular file.
   - `-d`: Directory exists.
   - `-e`: File exists (any type).
   - `-r`: File is readable.
   - `-w`: File is writable.
   - `-x`: File is executable.

2. **String Tests**:
   - `-z`: String is empty.
   - `-n`: String is not empty.
   - `=`: String equality.
   - `!=`: String inequality.

---

#### **String Operations**
- String comparison: `<` (lexically less than), `>` (lexically greater than).
- String length: `${#string}`.
- Substring extraction: `${string:start:length}`.

---

#### **Arithmetic Operations**
1. **Arithmetic Evaluation**:
   ```bash
   $(( expression ))
   ```
2. **Using `let`**:
   ```bash
   let "result = a + b"
   ```
3. **Using `expr`**:
   ```bash
   expr $a + $b
   ```

---

#### **Input/Output**
- `read`: Reads input from the user.
- `echo`: Prints a message to the terminal.
- `printf`: Formats and prints data.

---

#### **File Operations**
- `touch`: Create an empty file.
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
- `rm`: Delete files.
- `rmdir`: Remove directories.
- `cat`: Read and output the content of a file.
- Write to a file:
  - Overwrite: `echo "text" > file.txt`
  - Append: `echo "text" >> file.txt`

---

#### **Working with Command-Line Arguments**
1. **Access Individual Arguments**:
   - `$1`, `$2`, ..., `$N` for positional arguments.
2. **Loop Through All Arguments**:
   ```bash
   for arg in "$@"; do
       echo "$arg"
   done
   ```

---

#### **Error Handling**
- **Exit Status**:
   - `$?`: Contains the exit status of the last command.
- **Fail-Safe Script**:
   ```bash
   set -euo pipefail
   ```

---

#### **Tips for Complex Scripts**
1. **Modularize Code**:
   - Use functions or source external files.
2. **Organize Directory Structure**:
   - Separate scripts, logs, and resources logically.
3. **Document Your Code**:
   - Use comments to describe the purpose of functions and logic.
4. **Use Version Control**:
   - Track changes with Git for collaboration and version history.
