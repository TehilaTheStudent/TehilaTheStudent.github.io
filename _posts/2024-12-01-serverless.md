The need for a server to run depends on whether a feature or functionality requires **server-side computing**. Here's a clear distinction of when server-side processing is needed and when it isn't:

---

### **When Does a Server Need to Run?**

A server is required whenever functionality involves any of the following:

#### **1. Dynamic Content Generation**
- **Why**: When content needs to be customized for each user or request.
- **Examples**:
  - Rendering server-side HTML for logged-in users with unique data (e.g., dashboards).
  - Generating PDF files or other resources dynamically.
  - API responses with user-specific data.

#### **2. Data Storage and Management**
- **Why**: Interacting with databases or storage systems for retrieving or saving data.
- **Examples**:
  - Fetching data for a user's profile from a database.
  - Updating records (e.g., submitting a form, uploading files).
  - Running complex queries or aggregations in databases.

#### **3. Authentication and Authorization**
- **Why**: Verifying a user's identity securely and managing access control.
- **Examples**:
  - Logging in and managing user sessions or tokens.
  - Validating permissions for accessing specific resources.

#### **4. Business Logic Execution**
- **Why**: Performing calculations, validations, or actions based on input or business rules.
- **Examples**:
  - Calculating shipping costs based on location.
  - Validating input against complex rules (e.g., validating payment transactions).
  - Processing orders and payments.

#### **5. Secure Operations**
- **Why**: Sensitive operations must be handled server-side to prevent exposure to clients.
- **Examples**:
  - Encrypting and decrypting data.
  - Managing API keys or secrets.
  - Interacting with third-party services securely.

#### **6. Server-Side API and Backend Services**
- **Why**: Serving as a central hub for handling requests and integrating with other services.
- **Examples**:
  - Providing REST or GraphQL APIs.
  - Integrating with external APIs like Stripe, Twilio, or AWS.
  - Coordinating microservices or managing queues.

#### **7. Long-Running or Heavy Processing**
- **Why**: Client devices (like browsers) lack the capacity or security for such tasks.
- **Examples**:
  - Machine learning model inference or training.
  - Video/audio transcoding.
  - Performing batch operations on data.

#### **8. Scheduled Tasks**
- **Why**: Running periodic background jobs or triggers that donâ€™t depend on user interactions.
- **Examples**:
  - Sending daily email summaries.
  - Clearing expired sessions or tokens.
  - Generating reports overnight.

#### **9. Real-Time Communication**
- **Why**: Managing stateful real-time connections with users.
- **Examples**:
  - WebSockets for live updates in chat apps.
  - Real-time notifications or streaming data.
  - Multiplayer gaming backend synchronization.

### **When Does a Server Not Need to Run?**

A server isn't required when the task can be handled directly on the client-side, using the user's browser or device. Examples include:

#### **1. Static Content**
- **Examples**:
  - Serving pre-built HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
  - Loading static images, videos, or fonts.

#### **2. Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**
- **Examples**:
  - React or Vue apps fetching data via APIs and rendering on the client.
  - Animations or interactions handled with JavaScript.

#### **3. Local Storage and Computation**
- **Examples**:
  - Saving small amounts of user data in `localStorage` or `IndexedDB`.
  - Performing calculations or transformations directly in the browser.

#### **4. Cacheable Content**
- **Examples**:
  - Serving assets via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) with caching.
  - Pre-generating pages (Static Site Generation or ISR in frameworks like Nuxt).

#### **5. Authentication Tokens**
- **Examples**:
  - Storing and validating JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) in the browser (validation logic can be client-side if securely signed).

#### **6. Offline Functionality**
- **Examples**:
  - Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that store data offline and sync when online.
  - Local caching of user data for viewing without internet access.

### **Examples of Features and Where They Run**

| **Feature**              | **Needs Server?** | **Reason**                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Static homepage          | No               | The page is pre-built and can be served directly from a CDN.                                                                                                 |

| Dashboard with data      | Yes              | User-specific data needs to be fetched from a database and rendered dynamically.                                                                             |
| Search bar (local data)  | No               | If the data is local, the search can be implemented in the browser with JavaScript.                                                                          |
| Search bar (external DB) | Yes              | Searching a database requires server-side queries.                                                                                                           |
| Contact form submission  | Yes              | Submissions need to be processed and stored on a server or database.                                                                                        |
| Image gallery            | No               | Pre-uploaded images can be served statically from a CDN.                                                                                                     |
| Video streaming          | Yes              | Real-time delivery and transcoding of video require a backend.                                                                                               |
| Email notifications      | Yes              | Sending emails requires a backend to interact with an SMTP server or email API.                                                                              |

### **Summary**

A server is necessary for **dynamic, secure, or resource-intensive tasks** that cannot be handled safely or efficiently on the client side. If your app is mostly static or has minimal interactivity, you can often rely on client-side functionality and CDNs, avoiding the need for a server. However, modern serverless and hybrid solutions (like Vercel or AWS Lambda) let you seamlessly incorporate server-side capabilities only where they're needed.
