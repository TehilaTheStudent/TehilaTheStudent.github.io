### **What Would Be Done Without These Solutions?**
- **Without Sockets**: Developers would rely on REST APIs or shared files, increasing latency.
- **Without Shared Memory**: Applications would serialize and deserialize data to communicate.
- **Without Message Queues**: Systems would need direct communication, leading to tight coupling.
- **Without Kafka**: Event-driven systems would rely on polling, adding delays and inefficiencies.
