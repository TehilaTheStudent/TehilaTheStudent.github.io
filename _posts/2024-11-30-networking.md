### **Essential Installation Commands (Optional)**
Some tools like `iftop`, `nload`, and `speedtest-cli` may need installation:

- **Install `iftop`**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install iftop
  ```

- **Install `nload`**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install nload
  ```

- **Install `speedtest-cli`**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install speedtest-cli
  ```

### **How to Use This Table**
1. Start with **`ip addr`** to see all active network interfaces and their IPs.
2. Use **`ip route`** to understand routing (default gateway).
3. Check active connections with **`netstat`** or **`ss`**.
4. Dive deeper into wireless or DNS settings with **`iwconfig`**, **`nmcli`**, or **`cat /etc/resolv.conf`**.
5. Test connectivity with **`ping`** and speed with **`speedtest-cli`**.
